	NOTES ON BUILDING AN OFFLINE-CAPABLE WEBAPP
	
	1. 	This doesn't have to to be an HTML file. Anything that outputs HTML is fine. 
	2. 	It doesn't have to be called index either. 
		You'll need to change the Gruntfile watch index task and both htmlbuild tasks to accomodate that change though. 
	3. 	Any comment starting with NOTE: can be deleted.
	4.	This note should also be deleted. Won't break anything if you don't remove it, but why would you keep it?
